# Professional-Portfolio

## Description 

My motivation going into this project was to challenge myself and learn what i needed to progress, this was hard in the beginning but i backtracked to the lessons that was necessary to this project and even had to seek the help of the internet. Because of this I learned some interesting features such as colors. I built this protfolio to keep track all of my work/projects and maybe update as I go to use for future employers. The problem that I solved while making this project  was creating a website to potentially use for applying to jobs. During this project I learned that about color fusing colors and the importance of using CSS as i was having trouble in the beginning.
